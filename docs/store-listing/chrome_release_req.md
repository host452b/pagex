### 软件包中的标题
Pagex


### 软件包中的摘要
Extract page content into AI-ready JSON, capture full-page screenshots, and export cookies — all offline.


### 说明（最长 16,000 字符）
Pagex is a Chrome extension that extracts page content into structured JSON, captures full-page screenshots, and exports cookies — all locally, without sending data anywhere.

It helps you collect visible content, hidden content, expandable sections, frame results, and lightweight style context without copying raw HTML by hand. The extension is built for people who need to move web content into AI, automation, or internal analysis workflows with a cleaner and more controlled payload.

What Pagex does:

Page extraction
- Parse the selected tab directly from the popup
- Expand common disclosure patterns such as details, aria-expanded="false", and fragment-based collapse controls
- Trigger lazy-loaded content by scrolling before extraction
- Collect DOM and shadow DOM nodes into structured JSON
- Merge accessible frame results and label skipped or failed frames clearly
- Filter sensitive attributes and remove query strings and hashes from exported values
- Download the final payload as a JSON file
- Stop a running extraction and retry at any time
- Live countdown showing estimated time remaining per stage

Full-page screenshot
- Capture the entire scrollable page as a stitched PNG
- Automatically handle SPA pages with non-document scrolling containers
- Hide scrollbars and neutralize fixed/sticky elements for clean output
- Wait for lazy-loaded images before each capture
- Scale down automatically for very long pages
- No extra permissions needed

Cookie and storage export
- Export all cookies for the selected tab in Netscape cookies.txt format (curl/wget compatible)
- Include localStorage and sessionStorage data in the export
- Works with any site you have permission to access
- Output header clearly states data never leaves your device

Everything runs locally — no data is ever sent to a server.

## 隐私权

### 单一用途说明（最长 1,000 字符）

This extension extracts page content into structured JSON, captures full-page screenshots, and exports cookies for the selected tab. All processing happens locally in the browser — no data is sent to any server. The user controls when to extract, screenshot, or export by clicking buttons in the popup. Output is saved as downloaded files on the user's device.


### 需请求权限的理由

**需请求 activeTab 的理由：**
This extension reads the current page content to extract structured data, capture viewport screenshots for full-page stitching, and identify the selected tab. It only activates when the user clicks the extension icon. No data is collected or transmitted — all processing happens locally on the device.


**需请求 cookies 的理由：**
Reads cookies for the selected tab when the user clicks the "Get cookies.txt" button in the popup. Cookie data is formatted in Netscape cookies.txt format and saved as a local file download. Cookie data is never sent to any server or stored beyond the downloaded file.


**需请求 scripting 的理由：**
Injects a content script into the selected tab to collect page structure, scroll the page for full-page screenshots, and read localStorage/sessionStorage for the cookie export. Only activates when the user clicks a button in the popup. No scripts are loaded from remote sources.


**需请求 storage 的理由：**
Stores extension session state (parse status, extraction result summaries, and the last generated payload) locally on the device using chrome.storage.session. This data persists only during the browser session for popup state restoration. No data is synced to external servers.


**需请求 tabs 的理由：**
Reads tab titles and URLs to populate the tab picker dropdown in the popup, allowing the user to choose which tab to extract, screenshot, or export cookies from. Tab information is only used locally in the popup UI and never transmitted.


**需请求 webNavigation 的理由：**
Inspects frame coverage for the current tab using webNavigation.getAllFrames to identify accessible frames, cross-origin frames, and skipped frames during page extraction. Frame metadata is included in the extraction result for completeness. No navigation data is stored or transmitted.


**需请求主机权限的理由：**
Optional host permissions are requested per-origin only when the user chooses to extract, screenshot, or export cookies from a specific site. The extension uses optional_host_permissions with <all_urls> so that Chrome prompts the user for each new origin. No blanket host access is granted at install time.
