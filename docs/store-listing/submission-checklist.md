  - `cookies`
  - `scripting`
  - `storage`
  - `tabs`
  - `webNavigation`
  - optional site access by origin request
- [ ] Fill permission justifications:

**activeTab:**
"This extension reads the current page content to extract structured data, capture screenshots, and export cookies. It only activates when the user clicks the extension icon. No data is collected or transmitted — all processing happens locally."

**cookies:**
"Reads cookies for the selected tab when the user clicks 'Get cookies.txt'. Cookie data is exported locally as a text file and never sent to any server."

**scripting:**
"Injects a content script into the selected tab to collect page structure, scroll for screenshots, and read localStorage/sessionStorage. Only activates on user action."

**storage:**
"Stores extension session state (parse status, result summaries) locally on the device. No data is synced to external servers."

**tabs:**
"Reads tab titles and URLs to populate the tab picker in the popup. This information is only used locally and never transmitted."

**webNavigation:**
"Inspects frame coverage for the current tab to identify accessible and cross-origin frames during extraction."

## 6. Security self-check / 安全自检

- [ ] No `eval()` or `new Function()` in production code
- [ ] No `innerHTML` with user input in production code
- [ ] No remote `<script src="https://...">` loading
- [ ] CSP does not contain `unsafe-eval`
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys, secrets, or tokens
- [ ] No `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` — extension never phones home
- [ ] Permissions are minimal and each is justified above

## 7. Compliance self-check / 合规自检

- [ ] Screenshots reflect real product behavior
- [ ] Promo images use brand styling, not fake Chrome system warnings
- [ ] Listing text is accurate, current, and complete
- [ ] Description does not contain anonymous testimonials
- [ ] Description does not repeat keywords unnaturally
- [ ] Privacy claims match actual code behavior

- [ ] Confirm Stop button works during extraction
- [ ] Confirm Download JSON works
- [ ] Confirm Screenshot Full Page works
